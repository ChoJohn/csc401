------Section 3.1-------
The commands I used to run these experiments were, for SVM, NB, and DT respectively:
java -cp /u/cs401/WEKA/weka.jar weka.classifiers.functions.SMO -t part31.arff -x 10 -o
java -cp /u/cs401/WEKA/weka.jar weka.classifiers.bayes.NaiveBayes -t part31.arff -x 10 -o
java -cp /u/cs401/WEKA/weka.jar weka.classifiers.trees.J48 -t part31.arff -x 10 -o
From running these 3 classifiers on the arff file I built, I found that the accuracies were as follows (on 10 fold cv):
SVM: 50.76%
NB: 43.80%
DT: 46.08%
So based on these results, the best classifier for this task is the support vector machine.
------Section 3.2-------
The commands I used to run the experiments with and without cv were respectively:
java -cp /u/cs401/WEKA/weka.jar weka.classifiers.functions.SMO -t part32.arff -x 10 -o
java -cp /u/cs401/WEKA/weka.jar weka.classifiers.functions.SMO -t part32.arff -T part32.arff -o
